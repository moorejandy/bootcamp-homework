                  <p>Embarking on a new chaper with this coding thang. I don't know exactly
                    how I expect this to impact my career or my life, but that is part of the excitement, isn't it?
                </p>
                <br>
                    <p>I'd like to continue
                    to make a positive impact in soceity, and I'm hoping that this will give
                    me some leverage to do it my way. Even if that just means increasing my earning
                    potential so I am free to volunteer with orgs I am passionate about.
